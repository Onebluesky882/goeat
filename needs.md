## Build Your Own Real-Time System

Setup WebSocket server in Node.js
Frontend WebSocket client:
Trigger DB writes and broadcast changes to clients.

✅ Pros: Full control, works with any DB
❌ Cons: You must handle reconnection, scaling, and security
❌ 1. Reconnection Handling
If a client disconnects (due to network issues), you need to:

Detect the disconnect

Attempt reconnection automatically

Restore state or missed data

This involves WebSocket heartbeats, exponential backoff, and retry logic.

❌ 2. Scalability
With many users, you can’t rely on a single WebSocket server.

You must:

Use horizontal scaling (multiple servers)

Share state/events across them (usually with Redis pub/sub or a message broker like NATS, Kafka, or MQTT)

Load balance connections properly

❌ 3. Security
WebSocket connections must be:

Authenticated (via JWT or session)

Authorized (only see data they’re allowed to)

Rate-limited and protected from DoS attacks

You must also handle things like CORS, origin checks, and TLS (wss).

❌ 4. Persistence and History
If the client goes offline for 10 minutes, how will they catch up on missed events?

You'll need a system to store events (event log, database, etc.)

And logic to deliver only what's relevant when they reconnect.

❌ 5. DevOps Complexity
You'll need to:

Set up and manage your own WebSocket or real-time gateway

Monitor connections, health, metrics

Log and trace real-time traffic

Set up message brokers and horizontal scaling logic
